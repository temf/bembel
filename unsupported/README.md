This directory contains contributions from various users.
They are provided "as is", without any support. Nevertheless,
most of them are subject to be included in Bembel in the future.

In order to use an unsupported module you have to do either:

 - add the path_to_bembel/unsupported directory to your include path and do:
   #include <Bembel/ModuleHeader>

 - or directly do:
   #include <unsupported/Bembel/ModuleHeader>
