/**
 * \ingroup Geometry
 * \brief typedef of SurfacePoint
 *
 * This typedef is essential for any evaluation of a bilinear form. It provides
 * all required geometry information, stored as follows:
 * (0) x-coordinate of the evaluation point in the parameter domain [0,1]^2
 *     of the current element, i.e we map [0,1]^2->element->surface
 * (1) y-coordinate of the evaluation point in the parameter domain [0,1]^2
 *     of the current element, i.e we map [0,1]^2->element->surface
 * (2) a quadrature weight. Can be left empty if not used as part of a
 *     quadrature.
 * (3) x-coordinate of patch eval in space
 * (4) y-coordinate of patch eval in space
 * (5) z-coordinate of patch eval in space
 * (6) x-component of derivative in x-dir
 * (7) y-component of derivative in x-dir
 * (8) z-component of derivative in x-dir
 * (9) x-component of derivative in y-dir
 * (10) y-component of derivative in y-dir
 * (11) z-component of derivative in y-dir
 * For application of the pull-back to the reference domain, one requires the
 * jacobian of any point on the surface. Calling eval and evalJacobian of the
 * Patch class introduces work that needs to be done twice. The
 * updateSurdacePoint method is specialized and should be used, since it avoids
 * redundant work.
