## 1. Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

Bembel is the *Boundary Element Method Based Engineering Library* written in C++ library featuring higher order isogeometric Galerkin boundary element methods for Laplace, Helmholtz, and Maxwell problems.
Bembel is compatible with geometries from the Octave NURBS package, and provides an interface to the Eigen template library for linear algebra operations.
For computational efficiency, it applies an embedded fast multipole method tailored to the isogeometric analysis framework and a parallel matrix assembly based on OpenMP.

A good place to start is the introduction here: [Getting Started](https://temf.github.io/bembel/Doxy_out/html/_getting_started.html).
Furthermore, examples are provided in the `examples/` folder, where details can be found in the publication [[1]](#1).
Apart from that, a [Doxygen documentation](https://temf.github.io/bembel/Doxy_out/html/index.html) is available.

## 2. What is a Bembel?<a name="whatis"></a>

A traditional Hessian ceramic, as depicted in our logo. 
Quoting [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apfelwein):

> *Most establishments also serve Apfelwein by the Bembel (a specific Apfelwein
> jug), much like how beer can be purchased by the pitcher in many countries. The
> paunchy Bembel (made from salt-glazed stoneware) usually has a basic grey colour
> with blue-painted detailing.*

## 3. Features <a name="features"></a>

Current key features include

* Header-only implementation,
* Already implemented Laplace, Helmholtz and Maxwell single layer operator,
easily expendable to other operators,
* Arbitrary parametric mappings for the geometry representation, by default
realized as NURBS-mappings from files generated by the
[NURBS package](https://octave.sourceforge.io/nurbs/),
* Arbitrary-order B-Spline functions as Ansatz spaces, as in
the framework of isogeometric analysis for electromagnetics,
* An embedded interpolation-based fast multipole method for compression,
equivalent to the H2 matrix format,
* openMP parallelized matrix assembly,
* Full compatibility with the [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/) linear algebra library.
